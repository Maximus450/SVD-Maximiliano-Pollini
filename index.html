                <p class="card-text">Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!</p>

                        <h5>Farming</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Farming is an activity in Stardew Valley done on the player's farm. Players take seeds, plant them in the ground, and they will grow into crops. They must then be harvested and sold in order to make Gold. The player's ability to farm is measured as a skill.
                        There are 40+ crops and fruit trees.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Animals fulfill several roles on your farm. Some are wildlife, with which you cannot interact. You may have a pet, a cat or dog, with which you can form a friendship. You may get a horse to ride. And of course, you may buy "farm animals" that are a source of various kinds of produce, providing resources and profit. </p>

                        Each season - spring, summer, fall and winter - has a variety of fish you catch. Once you've mastered fishing, there are even five legendary fish for you to hunt down and capture.
                        You can breed fish in fish ponds on your farm, which will not only provide you with more fish, but a variety of useful items.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Artisan Goods are items that can be created using Artisan Equipment. They can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (in-game time) to be processed. Most Artisan Goods do not have a star quality, so the star quality of the ingredients used is ignored. The only exception is the Ostrich Egg, the star quality of whose artisan product will match that of the ingredient.</p>
